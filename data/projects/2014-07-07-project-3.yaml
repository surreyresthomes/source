description: Residents can be reidtered with local NHS or a private doctor of their choice. A chirodist vists regularly as does a hairdresser. These must be paid for by the residents at the time, or can be paid by us and cahrged at a cost, with a monthly account. We take every care that residents do not need to walk or travel far for day to day needs.
