description: For perfect quiet comfort and privacy, all residents have their own tastefully decorated and furnished rooms. We are happy for residents to bring in their own items of furniture and other personal belonging such as ornaments and pictures to help create a genuine home from home atmosphere. Each room has a wash hand basin. Many rooms have en-suite facilities. All of the rooms have central heating radiators with a seperate thermostatic control, enabling the temperature to be adjusted to suit the individual's requirements. In additition, each room is connected to a 24 hour emergency call system to summon help if required.
